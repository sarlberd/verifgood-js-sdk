# VerifgoodSDK Project Brief

## Project Overview

VerifgoodSDK is a TypeScript-based SDK designed to provide a streamlined interface for interacting with the Verifgood API. It serves as a wrapper around the API endpoints, offering a more developer-friendly experience with type safety, consistent error handling, and simplified request management.

## Core Requirements

1. **API Integration**: Provide seamless access to all Verifgood API endpoints
2. **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript to ensure type safety across all API interactions
3. **Authentication**: Handle API key authentication transparently
4. **Query Management**: Simplify filtering, pagination, and data retrieval
5. **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling across all API requests
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for all SDK features

## Target Audience

- Developers integrating with the Verifgood platform
- Internal teams building applications on top of the Verifgood API
- Partners requiring programmatic access to Verifgood services

## Project Scope

The SDK covers the following core functionalities:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**: Managing API keys and authentication tokens
2. **Data Retrieval**: Fetching data from various endpoints with filtering and pagination
3. **Data Manipulation**: Creating, updating, and deleting resources
4. **Invitation Management**: Handling user invitations and registration
5. **Metadata Management**: Configuring and managing request metadata

## Success Criteria

1. Simplified API interaction compared to direct REST API calls
2. Reduced development time for applications using the Verifgood API
3. Type-safe interactions that catch errors at compile time
4. Comprehensive documentation that reduces the learning curve

## Constraints

1. Must maintain backward compatibility with existing API structure
2. Must support both browser and Node.js environments
3. Must minimize external dependencies
4. Must provide TypeScript type definitions for all public interfaces
