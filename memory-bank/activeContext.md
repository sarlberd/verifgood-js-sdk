# VerifgoodSDK Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The VerifgoodSDK is currently focused on providing a stable, type-safe interface to the Verifgood API. The SDK is structured around a core set of classes that handle API communication, authentication, and request formatting, with specialized service classes for each API domain.

### Key Components in Active Development

1. **Core Infrastructure**
   - VGSDK: Main entry point for the SDK
   - HttpClient: Handles HTTP communication
   - ApiRequest: Base class for API requests
   - Metadatas: Manages query parameters
   - Auth: Handles authentication

2. **Service Implementations**
   - Categories: Category management
   - Checkpoints: Checkpoint management
   - Equipements: Equipment management
   - Invitations: User invitation management
   - Lieux: Location management
   - SharedLinks: Shared link management
   - Taches: Task management

3. **Documentation and Examples**
   - API documentation using TypeDoc
   - Example code for common use cases
   - Comprehensive README and usage guides

## Recent Changes

1. **Invitations Service Enhancement**
   - Added support for generating invitation links
   - Implemented invitation validation
   - Added registration completion functionality
   - Improved error handling for invitation processes

2. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Generated comprehensive API documentation
   - Added more detailed examples
   - Improved method documentation with JSDoc comments

3. **Error Handling Refinements**
   - Enhanced error logging
   - Improved error message clarity
   - Added better error handling in HTTP client

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### 1. API Response Type Safety

**Context**: Currently, many API responses use `any` as the return type, which reduces type safety.

**Decision Pending**: Whether to create specific interfaces for all API responses to improve type safety.

**Considerations**:
- Improved type safety would catch more errors at compile time
- More specific types would improve IDE autocompletion
- Creating and maintaining these interfaces requires significant effort
- API changes would require updating these interfaces

### 2. Authentication Mechanism

**Context**: The SDK currently uses a simple API key authentication mechanism.

**Decision Pending**: Whether to support more advanced authentication methods like OAuth.

**Considerations**:
- OAuth would provide better security for certain use cases
- Supporting multiple authentication methods increases complexity
- Current API key approach is simpler for basic use cases
- Token refresh mechanisms would need to be implemented

### 3. Error Handling Strategy

**Context**: Error handling is currently basic, with simple try/catch blocks and error logging.

**Decision Pending**: Whether to implement a more sophisticated error handling strategy.

**Considerations**:
- Custom error classes could provide more context
- Retry mechanisms could improve resilience
- Error categorization could help clients handle different error types
- More sophisticated error handling increases complexity

### 4. Offline Support

**Context**: The SDK currently requires an active internet connection.

**Decision Pending**: Whether to implement offline support with local caching.

**Considerations**:
- Offline support would improve user experience in poor connectivity
- Synchronization of offline changes is complex
- Storage mechanisms would need to be implemented
- Conflict resolution strategies would be required

## Next Steps

### Short-term Priorities

1. **Complete Type Definitions**
   - Create specific interfaces for all API responses
   - Replace `any` return types with specific interfaces
   - Improve parameter type definitions

2. **Enhance Documentation**
   - Add more comprehensive examples
   - Improve method documentation
   - Create tutorials for common use cases

3. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Implement custom error classes
   - Add better error categorization
   - Improve error messages and context

### Medium-term Goals

1. **Add Testing Infrastructure**
   - Implement unit tests for core functionality
   - Add integration tests for API interactions
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement request batching
   - Add caching mechanisms
   - Optimize bundle size

3. **Advanced Query Features**
   - Enhance Metadatas class with more query capabilities
   - Add support for complex filtering
   - Implement sorting and advanced pagination

### Long-term Vision

1. **Offline-first Architecture**
   - Implement robust offline support
   - Add synchronization capabilities
   - Develop conflict resolution strategies

2. **Advanced Authentication**
   - Support OAuth flows
   - Implement token refresh
   - Add multi-tenant support

3. **Ecosystem Expansion**
   - Create framework-specific integrations (React, Vue, etc.)
   - Develop CLI tools for API interaction
   - Build additional utilities and helpers
